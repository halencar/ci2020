# Projeto Github Actions
Esse projeto tem o objetivo de ensinar Continous Integration para nós da turma de Engenharia de Software II da Unijuazeiro.

## Tarefas a serem implementas no CI

- [x] Fazer o checkout do projeto no CI
- [x] Fazer a configuração do ambiente (versaão do node e instalação das dependencias)
- [x] Executar os testes
- [x] Quando enviado para o master, fazer o build do projeto
- [x] Disponibilizar o relatorio de combertura de testes e build ao fim do workflow
- [x] Quando enviado para o master, fazer a implantação do projeto do projeto no [link](http://ci2020-alencaar.surge.sh/)
## Scripts Disponíveis

Na raiz do projeto você poderá executar:

### `npm start`

Para executar a aplição em modo de desenvolvimento.
Acesse [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) para visualizar no navegador.

A página deverá recarregar a cada edição.
Você também poderá ver erros de 'lint' no console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
